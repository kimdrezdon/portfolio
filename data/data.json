			"description": "This full stack application uses React and a REST API built using Sequelize, Express, Node.js and JavaScript to provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating or deleting courses in the database. In addition, the app requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. Navigation links and buttons will dynamically display based on whether there is an authenticated user logged in or not. Error messages are displayed in any validations fail when updating or creating a course, as well as during user sign up.",

			"description": "This project is a browser-based phrase guessing game, created using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming. After clicking the Start Game button, the game board is revealed with a randomly selected phrase. The user guesses a letter by either clicking on the onscreen keyboard or by pressing the selected letter on their own keyboard, disabling that letter for future guesses. If the selected letter matches a letter in the phrase, the matching letter(s) in the phrase are revealed. If the selected letter does not match a letter in the phrase, one of the user’s five hearts is removed. The player keeps guessing either until they guess all the letters and win, or they use up all of their hearts and lose the game.",
