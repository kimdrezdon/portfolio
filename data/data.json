			"description": "This project is an employee directory for a fictional company. It uses Fetch API to request data from the Random User Generator API. The JSON object from the API is parsed and a card is created for each employee with basic contact information. Clicking on an employee’s card will display a modal window with additional information. Within the modal window, employees can be toggled through continuously without having to exit the modal. The list of employees can be filtered using the search field.",

			"description": "This project is a browser-based phrase guessing game, created using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming. After clicking the Start Game button, the game board is revealed with a randomly selected phrase. The user guesses a letter by either clicking on the onscreen keyboard or by pressing the selected letter on their own keyboard, disabling that letter for future guesses. If the selected letter matches a letter in the phrase, the matching letter(s) in the phrase are revealed. If the selected letter does not match a letter in the phrase, one of the user’s 5 lives is removed. The player keeps guessing either until they guess all the letters and win, or they use up all 5 of their lives and lose the game.",

Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the 'Skip's Scramble', an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble.
