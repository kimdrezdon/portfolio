What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar.",

I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City.

Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the 'Skip's Scramble', an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble.

It's like my heart is getting hard. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON.

I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it? The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me.",
