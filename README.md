# techdegree-project-6
Static Node.js and Express Site

This project is my portfolio, created using server-side JavaScript, Node.js, Express and Pug. 

This project is hosted on Heroku, but can also be run in the terminal using 'node app.js' or 'npm start'.

I have changed the fonts, colors, background colors and added a transition effect to the project thumbnails on the main page. 

An error message is displayed on the page as well as in the console when a user navigates to a path that does not exist.
