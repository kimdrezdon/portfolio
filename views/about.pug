            | Hello! My name is Kim Drezdon and I am a Full Stack JavaScript Developer residing in Austin, Texas. I am a graduate of the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program at Treehouse. It has been an exciting journey learning how to build dynamic interactive websites. I am self-motivated and enthusiastic about programming, with a desire to learn and work as part of a team. I offer strong analytical and problem solving skills, with a professional background in the deadline-driven field of accounting. My hobbies include reading, crafting and hiking. I am currently working on the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I am enrolled in Harvard's CS50 Intro to Computer Science course on edX, and am also actively taking courses on Udemy. Check out the links to my profiles and certifications!
